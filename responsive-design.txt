make img responsive 
The max-width property of 100% scales the image to fit the width of its container, but the image won't stretch wider than its original width. Setting the display property to block changes the image from an inline element (its default), to a block element on its own line. The height property of auto keeps the original aspect ratio of the image.

Use a Retina Image for Higher Resolution Displays
The simplest way to make your images appear "retina" (and optimize them for retina displays) is to define their width and height values as only half of what the original file is.

Make Typography Responsive

The four different viewport units are:

vw: 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
vh: 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
vmin: 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height vs. width).
vmax: 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height vs. width).
